<p>I needed bus stop coordinates for this project, so I used a map from Port Authority's website. To get the Downtown bus stop coordinates, I eliminated all layers on the map except the bus stops and assigned each stop a marker that allowed me to view the coordinates. I then copied and pasted each set of coordinates into an Excel file and exported it as a csv for the project. The link to Port Authority's map is here:</p>
